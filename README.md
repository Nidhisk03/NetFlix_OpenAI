Netflix OpenAI

This project involves creating a Netflix clone using ReactJS. 
I'm developing a user-friendly interface with components like the main page and movie lists, styling them to resemble Netflix. 
The key addition to my project is the integration of OpenAI's GPT model through the OpenAI API for personalized movie recommendations.
By employing Redux, I am managing the global state, ensuring seamless communication between React components, and facilitating a smooth flow of data, including user preferences and OpenAI responses. 
The inclusion of Redux enhances the scalability and maintainability of the application.
